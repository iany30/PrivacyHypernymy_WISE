6. Cookies and Online Tracking Technologies
DW may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and other third-party tracking technologies such as web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage) to collect general and personally identifiable information about visitors to the Websites. The information collected is used to improve the experience of the Websites and Services, such as allowing us to recognize you when you revisit the Websites to provide you with customized information and/or to remember your preferences. We use cookies and other third-party tracking technologies such as web beacons to collect Personal Information. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
If you use our mobile application on a desktop, a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a Resettable Device Identifier from your device. Resettable Device Identifiers (also known as mobile advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the “Identifier for Advertisers” (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
For more information on how to manage cookies and the categories of cookies used on the Websites, please see below (“Preference Management”).


6. Online Advertising
We may partner with third parties (Third Party Providers and Advertisers, collectively known as “Advertisers”) that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant online advertising to you. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie on your computer, device or directly in our emails/communications, and we may share Personal Information with them, as permitted by law and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our partners may link the Personal Information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our partners may deliver an ad to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website. We may use automated decision-making to customize your experience based on your personal information.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown on the Websites, the Services or on third-party websites.
To opt out of receiving online targeted or behavioral advertising, please see below (“Preference Management”).


7. Do Not Track Disclosure
Additionally, although some Internet browsers have a ‘do not track’ feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, we are currently not set up to respond to such signals.


8. Sharing Your Information
DW does not sell, trade, or disclose your Personal Information to third parties except as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as follows:
• To designated service providers we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
• To DW corporate affiliated entities.
• To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, change in control, or other sale, transfer, or other action with respect to of some or all of DW assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by DW about the Website users is among the assets affected.

Additionally, if you provide content to the Services, such as submitting comments or content as a part of a DW subscription, any information that you submit will become public. It may become accessible through search engines or, if you sign in using credentials from a third-party social networking service, to users on that service.
This Section 8 does not apply to information obtained by Daily Wire through the text messaging short code. Daily Wire does not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease or otherwise transfer for profit any phone numbers or personal information collected through the Daily Wire short code texting program to any third party. Nonetheless, Daily Wire reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, to avoid liability, or to protect Daily Wire’s rights or property.


9. Retention of Personal Information
We retain your Personal Information for as long as we have a relationship with you. We may retain your Personal Information for a period of time after our relationship with you has ended where there is an ongoing business need to retain it, including to comply with our legal, regulatory, tax and/or accounting obligations. We will do so in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable law.
DW does not access or store your financial information when you subscribe to our Services. DW partners with third party providers to process payments.

To submit a request to exercise any of your California privacy rights, please contact us using one of the following methods:
• Via our Privacy Center
• Via email to privacy@DailyWire.com
You may use an authorized agent to submit requests. We do not discriminate against a user if they exercise any of the rights available under the CCPA. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your Personal Information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt-in to the program and you can opt-out of each program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) prospectively by following the instructions in the applicable program description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly. We will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the consumer about whom we collected Personal Information. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.
We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

a. The Legal Basis for Using EEA/UK Personal Information — For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, we advise that your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different than those in your country and may not be as protective. The United States has not received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information is to do so with your consent; where we need the personal information for performance of a contract or requested service, including to provide you with our daily Newsletter, or where the collection and use is in our or another’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the personal information in question. If we collected your Personal Information with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.
Our retention of your personal information and any subsequent communications are based on our legitimate interest in providing you with new and potentially relevant materials based on your geography, role, or company. As always, you can elect to opt out from receiving such future communications.
To the extent that we transfer personal information from the EEA or UK to a jurisdiction outside the EEA or UK that has not been adduced by the European Commission or UK as providing adequate data protections (such as the United States), we will ensure that such Personal Information is safeguarded through appropriate contractual terms or other approved mechanisms.
b. Rights for EEA and UK Residents — In addition, if you are a resident of the EEA or UK, you have the right to:
• Find out if we use your personal information, to access your Personal Information, and receive copies of your personal information.
• Withdraw any express consent that you have provided to the processing of your Personal Information at any time without penalty.
• Access your Personal Information and have it corrected or amended if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
• Obtain a transferable copy of some of your Personal Information which can be transferred to another provider when the Personal Information was processed based on your consent.
• If you believe your Personal Information is inaccurate, no longer necessary for our business purposes, or if you object to our processing of your Personal Information, you also have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your data pending our investigation and/or verification of your claim.
• Request your Personal Information be deleted or restricted under certain circumstances. For example, if is using your Personal Information on the basis of your consent and has no other legal basis to use such, you may request your Personal Information be deleted when you withdraw your consent.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
If we ask you to provide personal information to us to comply with a legal requirement or enter into a contract, we will inform you of this and let you know whether providing us with your Personal Information is required and if not, the consequences of not sharing your Personal Information with us.
Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our or a third party’s legitimate interests and those interests are not already described above, we will let you know what those legitimate interests are.
We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
To withdraw consent or exercise these rights, please contact us via email at privacy@DailyWire.com.
If you are not satisfied with our response, or believe we are processing your Personal Information in violation of the law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Supervisory Authority (also known as Data Protection Authority) or other appropriate governmental authority in your EEA Member State or the UK, as applicable. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.
